Simple Shell
 This group project is very importamt in the ALX programme and ends Sprint 1 in the ALX SE programme. It involves combining all of what we have learnt in the 3 months we started the programme. In this project we used C Language to build a simple shell.

Description
The shell is a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems. The shell is both an interactive command language and a scripting language, and is used by the operating system to control the execution of the system using shell scripts.
